# Christmas tree

This project was created with vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

Your grandmother has accumulated a large number of Christmas decorations. She asked you to help sort them out to choose the ones she will decorate the tree with this year. 

This application allows you to sort toys by name and number of copies, find a toy by name, group toys by type, add toys to favorites and remove from it, as well as an interactive page where you can decorate the Christmas tree with the selected toys.
